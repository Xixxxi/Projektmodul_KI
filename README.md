## Overview
Our project, titled "WORTH IT?", aims to raise awareness about the hidden ecological costs of AI technologies. Despite their numerous benefits, AI technologies consume enormous amounts of energy and natural resources. Our interactive exhibition, designed as a black cube, combines AI-driven transformations with a shocking outro to educate visitors playfully about these hidden environmental costs.
